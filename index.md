tags: awareness posters
level: 2
type: documentation
pitch: Application Security Awareness posters, email templates and other material for creating awareness campaigns for your engineers.

---

The Application Security Awareness Campaigns will make available sets of B2 posters that can be put up around your office and images for use in emails that introduce your engineers to numerous different security topics and include links to more information.

The objective of the material is to give the engineers a short introduction to the topic that will leave them wanting to learn more about it and point them to where they can dig deeper. The posters or images for emails should be both eye catching and informative.

## Recommendations:

You could strategically position the posters outside meeting rooms, so that while waiting for the meeting room to free up, engineers could read the posters. Posters will have QR Codes allowing them to follow up on their phone and read more about the topic.

You could also reinforce the message with the people who have already read the poster using the smaller versions of the images in a daily or bi weekly email newsletter which they could then keep as a handy reference. This also offers you the means to reach a larger audience of people working from home and people who simply haven't seen the posters around the office.

## Roadmap:
